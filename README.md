# learning-py
A repository full of puzzles and problems I used to learn the Python language.

If you're trying to learn just like me, I'll recommend using [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods) as documentation. Coming from MDN the [Official Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/) site is really difficult to use.
